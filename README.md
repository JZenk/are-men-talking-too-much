# are-men-talking-too-much

This is a silly & simple website for measuring who's dominating a conversation.

Use this at events! In meetings! While watching TV! The possibilities are endless.

### Why
When people talk about diversity & inclusion in tech, they often count bodies - what % of women at this company, what % women at an event, etc. But...inclusion is more than who's in the room. Often, in rooms that *seem* diverse, men still dominate conversations to a large extent.

I'm exploiting the mantra of "what gets measured gets managed" - hopefully, measuring participation can highlight disproportionality & ultimately make room for more voices.

### Steal this code
Gender is only one of many flavors of diversity. Time talking is a simplistic measure of participation. You're welcome to take this code, adapt it, & produce other hacks for inclusion. I wana see what you make - please do share! [@cthydng](https://twitter.com/cthydng/)
